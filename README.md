# Visual Cortex

This is my attempt at building a vision system in Nengo. The ultimate goal is to build a system that
1. Performs well on benchmarks such as MNIST, FashionMNIST, Cifar100, ImageNet.
2. Able to convert raw image inputs into Spiking Neuron representations, and eventually Semantic Pointers.
3. Able to take in video inputs by leveraging the dynamic properties of Spiking Neurons.
